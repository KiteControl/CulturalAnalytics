To succesfully run the notebook, one needs an extra file called cities.csv, which was to large to upload to github.

The link to this file can be found here https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/export/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name
where city and population data should be exported and imported into the project as a csv.

The Notebook uses this file to gather and store information concerning what cities it should gather information from. We then train the model on the grids that were created
and lastly analyze the grids with the corresponding data.
